Here is my understanding of the project:

  You want me to build a web application using Streamlit. The app will allow a non-technical user to upload a CSV
  file (like the Project5.csv provided) and explore it using natural language commands.

  The key features are:
   * Natural Language Input: Users can type commands like "show me the top 5 products" instead of using complex BI
     tools.
   * Clarity and Options: If a command is vague, the app should offer a few interpretations for the user to choose
     from. It should also always explain in simple terms what operation it just performed.
   * Core Functionality: The application must support common data operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and
     pivoting.
   * User Interface: The app will have a CSV uploader, a command box for text input, a main area to display charts and
     tables, and a panel to show suggestions and explanations.
   * Export: Users must be able to easily export the data they are currently viewing.

  The main goal is to create a tool that feels intuitive and smooth for someone who is not a data expert.

  I have reviewed the information in Project 5.txt and the preview of Project5.csv. My understanding is that the core of
  the project is to build a "Data Explorer" that can process natural language commands to analyze, pivot, and group the
  sales data contained in Project5.csv. The dataset includes various fields like date, region, product category, and
  financial metrics, which will be the basis for the queries.
