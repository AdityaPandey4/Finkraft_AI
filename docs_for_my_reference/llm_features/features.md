  1. Automated Data Profiling and Quality Check
   * What it is: When a user uploads a CSV, the application would automatically generate a quick
     summary of the data. This would include identifying column types (text, numbers, dates), counting
     missing values, and showing basic statistics (like average, min/max for numbers).
   * Why it's useful: This gives the user an immediate, high-level understanding of their dataset's
     health and structure. It can proactively flag issues (e.g., "This column has many missing
     values") and suggest simple cleaning steps, which is a common hurdle for non-technical users.

  2. Proactive "Insight" Suggestions
   * What it is: After a query is successfully executed, the AI could perform a secondary analysis on
     the results to find interesting patterns, outliers, or trends. It would then present these as
     optional "insights."
   * Why it's useful: Instead of waiting for the user's next command, the tool can guide their
     analysis. For example, after seeing sales by region, it might suggest, "ðŸ’¡ Insight: Sales in the 
     'North' region are 50% higher than the average. Would you like to see a breakdown of product 
     categories for this region?" This makes the tool feel more like a collaborative partner.

  3. Enhanced Visualization with Customization
   * What it is: Expand the charting capabilities beyond bar charts to include line charts (for
     time-series data), pie charts, and scatter plots. Crucially, allow users to modify these charts
     using natural language (e.g., "change the chart title to 'Monthly Revenue'", "now make the bars
     green").
   * Why it's useful: Visuals are the most intuitive way for users to understand data. Offering the
     right chart for the right data and allowing easy customization makes the analysis process more
     dynamic and the outputs more presentation-ready.

  4. Undo / Redo and Query History
   * What it is: Implement "undo" and "redo" buttons to easily step backward or forward through the
     analysis. A visible history of the queries run during the session would also be displayed.
   * Why it's useful: This encourages fearless exploration. Users can try any command, knowing they
     can instantly revert it if the result isn't what they expected. A query history helps them keep
     track of their thought process and easily revisit previous steps.

  5. Save, Load, and Enhanced Export
   * What it is: Allow users to save their entire analysis session (the data, the sequence of
     operations, and the generated charts) and load it again later. Also, enhance the export feature to
      download the current view not just as a CSV, but as a PDF or a PowerPoint slide containing the
     chart, data table, and the AI's explanation.
   * Why it's useful: This transforms the tool from a one-time utility into a persistent workspace.
     Users can stop and resume their work. Exporting to PDF/PPT makes it incredibly easy to share
     findings with colleagues or include them in reports, which is a very common real-world task.


     now that you have mentioned it, I thought of something, before implementing the this feature,   â”‚
â”‚    how about we create chat history feature, in which the user can basically chat through out and  â”‚
â”‚    we keep all the chat history, insights generated as well as the graphs, and at last when the    â”‚
â”‚    user says export, we can give them JSON, CSV as well as a PDF or PPT with complete summary of   â”‚
â”‚    the chat including the data insigth at the top, QnA graphs insights in a well structured manner
